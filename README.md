Novela ink is your own personal AI assistant platform to create/modify/enchance your stories.

With power of OpenAI it was possible to create a storywritter that can really fit into your needs.

With minimal effort you can quickly create PoC of stories, books, and creations.

You don't need expensive graphic designers, and copywriters.

It also helps with gettings an inspiration!

And everything is tamperproof, and immutable thanks to [immudb](https://immudb.io), so you can't really lose your creations.

Everything in cool markdown format.
